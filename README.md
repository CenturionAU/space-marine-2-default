## Prerequisites
To be able to use the game modifications contained within this repo, you will need a means of 
bypassing the game's Easy Anti Cheat (EAC).

## Modified Values
- **Health on Executions:** Executions restore a small amount of player health, regardless of 
contested health status.
- **No Melee Delay:** The small delay between each melee attack has been removed, resulting in 
faster melee.
- **No Ranged Spread:** Player ranged weapons have had their spread removed, vastly increasing precision.
- **Infinite Magazines:** Player ranged weapons have infinite magazines, effectively a bottomless clip.
- **Increased Damage:** Player ranged and melee weapons deal increased damage.
- **Heavy Bolter Fire Rate:** Heavy bolter has a flat fire rate and doesn't need to be spun up.
